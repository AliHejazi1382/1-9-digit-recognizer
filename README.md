# Handwritten Digit Recognition with Neural Networks

## Overview

This project implements a machine learning model using neural networks to recognize handwritten digits. The model is trained using TensorFlow and utilizes the `numpy` and `matplotlib` libraries for data manipulation and visualization. Given an image of a handwritten digit, the model predicts the corresponding digit with a high degree of accuracy.

## Features

- **Neural Network Architecture**: The project leverages a deep neural network built with TensorFlow to classify images of handwritten digits.
- **Data Visualization**: `matplotlib` is used to visualize the dataset and the model's predictions.
- **Pre-trained Model**: The project includes a pre-trained model that can be used out-of-the-box to predict handwritten digits.
### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following libraries installed:

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

You can install the necessary packages using `pip`:

```bash
pip install tensorflow
pip install numpy
```
